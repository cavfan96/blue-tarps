# Blue Tarp Project

This project was completed during 2nd semester at UVA’s MS in Data Science Program to fulfill the SYS6018 “Deep Mining” requirements.

The project develops a classifier for discerning “blue tarps” post 2010 Haiti Earthquake in a hypothetical scenario to aid rescue and response teams.

Multiple statistical models are developed and evaluated.
